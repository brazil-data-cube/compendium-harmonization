# Harmonization Compendium Documentation

Research Compendium documentation source code.

## Development

To develop the documentation, first, install the dependencies:

```sh
poetry install # or pip install .
```

Then start the `mkdocs` server:

```sh
mkdocs serve
```

That's it! Now access the address [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

## Acknowledgments

The documentation was created with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) using the [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme. Many thanks to the developers of both projects.
